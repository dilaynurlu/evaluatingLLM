You are given a target function from a Python library about HTTP requests.
Your task is to use pytest and generate complete, executable and unique test cases for this target function. 
The Python version is 3.12.7.
The pytest version is 8.4.2.

=================================================================================================================
Target function name:
{{FUNCTION_NAME}}



Target function definition:
{{FUNCTION_DEFINITION}}



Target function module name:
{{FUNCTION_MODULE}}



Here are the imports used by the module that defines {{FUNCTION_NAME}}:
{{IMPORTS}}



The target function depends on the following helper or dependency functions:
{{DEPENDENCIES}}

=================================================================================================================

Guidelines for dependencies:
- These dependency functions are provided for behavioral context only.
- You may use their observable behavior, inputs, outputs, and side effects to inform your test design and use mocks when needed.
- Do NOT generate tests for dependency functions.
- Do NOT reimplement dependency functions unless strictly necessary for isolation.
- All generated tests must directly test only {{FUNCTION_NAME}}.



Each generated test case must:
- Be fully self-contained and executable as its own file.
- You are not allowed to paste the target function into the test file for self-containtment purposes. You may only call the actual target function from the module {{FUNCTION_MODULE}}.
- Do not include Markdown code fences (```), output raw Python files only.
- Include all necessary imports.
- Define any required inputs or mock data/network.
- Invoke the function under test.
- Not rely on shared state between test cases.
- Be unique.
- Consider good security hygiene practices.
- Focus on high line and branch coverage. 

Output format requirements:
- Each test case must be separated using the delimiter:
  ===TESTCASE_FILE_START===
  (test file content)
  ===TESTCASE_FILE_END===
- In each of these delimeters, you should define only ONE test case with "def"

Now generate the unique test cases.
