You are given a target function from a Python library about HTTP requests.
Your task is to use pytest and generate N complete, executable and unique test cases for this target function. 
The Python version is 3.12.7.
The pytest version is 9.0.0.

Each test case must:
- Be fully self-contained and executable as its own file.
- You are not allowed to paste the target function into the test file for self-containtment purposes. You may only call the actual target function from the module {{FUNCTION_MODULE}}.
- Do not include Markdown code fences (```), output raw Python files only.
- Include all necessary imports.
- Define any required inputs or mock data.
- Invoke the function under test.
- Not rely on shared state between test cases.
- Be unique.
- Consider good security hygiene.

Output format requirements:
- Do NOT include any reasoning or explanations in this step.
- Each test file must be separated using the delimiter:
  ===TESTCASE_START===
  (test file content)
  ===TESTCASE_END===


Target function name:
{{FUNCTION_NAME}}

Target function description:
{{FUNCTION_DESCRIPTION}}

Target function module name:
{{FUNCTION_MODULE}}

Number of required test cases (N):
{{N}}

Now generate the initial N unique test cases.
