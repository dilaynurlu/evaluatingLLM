You are given a target function from a Python library about HTTP requests.
Your task is to use pytest and generate complete, executable and unique test cases for this target function. 
The Python version is 3.12.7.
The pytest version is 9.0.0.

=================================================================================================================
Target function name:
{{FUNCTION_NAME}}

Target function definition:
{{FUNCTION_DEFINITION}}

Target function module name:
{{FUNCTION_MODULE}}

=================================================================================================================


Each generated test case must:
- Be fully self-contained and executable as its own file.
- You are not allowed to paste the target function into the test file for self-containtment purposes. You may only call the actual target function from the module {{FUNCTION_MODULE}}.
- Do not include Markdown code fences (```), output raw Python files only.
- Include all necessary imports.
- Define any required inputs or mock data/network.
- Invoke the function under test.
- Not rely on shared state between test cases.
- Be unique.
- Consider good security hygiene practices.
- Focus on high line and branch coverage.

Output format requirements:
- Do NOT include any reasoning or explanations in this step.
- Each test file must be separated using the delimiter:
  ===TESTCASE_START===
  (test file content)
  ===TESTCASE_END===
- In each of these delimeters, you should only define one test case with "def"

Now generate the initial unique test cases.
