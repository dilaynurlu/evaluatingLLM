You are given a target function from a Python library about HTTP requests.
Additionally, you are also given several examples of test cases for the target function. 

Your task is to use pytest and generate N complete, executable and unique test cases for this target function. 
Use the given example test cases as guidance for structure, style, completeness, and formatting.

The Python version is 3.12.7.
The pytest version is 9.0.0.


===EXAMPLE_TESTCASE_START===
{{EXAMPLE_TESTS}}
===EXAMPLE_TESTCASE_END===


Your generated test cases must:
- Follow the same style and structure demonstrated in the examples.
- Be fully self-contained and executable as its own file.
- You are not allowed to paste the target function into the test file for self-containtment purposes. You may only call the actual target function from the module {{FUNCTION_MODULE}}.
- Do not include Markdown code fences (```), output raw Python files only.
- Include all necessary imports.
- Define any required inputs or mock data.
- Invoke the function under test.
- Not rely on shared state between test cases.
- Be unique.
- Consider good security hygiene.

Output format requirements:
- Do not include any explanations or reasoning—output, include only the test case files.
- Each generated test file must be separated using:
  ===TESTCASE_START===
  (test file content)
  ===TESTCASE_END===


Target function name:
{{FUNCTION_NAME}}

Target function description:
{{FUNCTION_DESCRIPTION}}

Target function module name:
{{FUNCTION_MODULE}}

Number of required test cases (N):
{{N}}

Now generate the N unique test cases, following the example structure as closely as possible.
