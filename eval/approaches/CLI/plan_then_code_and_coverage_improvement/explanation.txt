For this approach:

We use the gemini.md file and the individual prompts.

For the first batch of the tests, we enforce a static analysis in P1-P3 and generate the tests. 
The model also refined the failing tests.
The coverage results for this initial batch are in the first line of each corresponding coverage result csv file. 

Later in the cli we prompt the model explicitly "The human written test suite measures 62% coverage, try to perform similarly."
Then the model does a second round of refinement on the inital batch of tests, modifying them. 
The coverage results after this refinement are in the second line of each corresponding coverage result csv file.
