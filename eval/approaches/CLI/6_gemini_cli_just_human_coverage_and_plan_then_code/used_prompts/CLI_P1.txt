You are operating inside a Docker container with a mounted repository at /workspace.
Goal: Generate standalone pytest tests for multiple Requests functions by reading the source code directly from the repository.

Target functions (located across utils.py, auth.py, and sessions.py):
1. _basic_auth_str
2. _parse_content_type_header
3. get_auth_from_url
4. HTTPDigestAuth
5. prepend_scheme_if_needed
6. rebuild_auth
7. resolve_redirects
8. select_proxy
9. should_strip_auth
10. unquote_header_value


CRITICAL RULES:
- Only create new test files under: eval/tests/generated_tests/P1/
- Do NOT modify, delete, or rename any existing files anywhere in the repo.
- Do NOT touch /workspace/venv and do NOT run pip install or any dependency installation.
- It is allowed to read source files under: requests/src/requests/
- Tests must be deterministic and must NOT perform real network calls.

For EACH function F in the list:
- Locate and read the implementation of F in requests/src/requests/  Inspect direct dependencies used by F as needed.
- Create the directory (if missing): eval/tests/generated_tests/P1/F/
- BEFORE writing any test code for F, perform and OUTPUT a short static analysis for F:
    -List every conditional branch (if/elif/else) that matters for behavior.
    -List every exception that can be raised or handled (raise, try/except).
    -List every loop condition / termination behavior.
    -For each item, describe one concrete input/state that would trigger it. Keep this analysis concise (bullet points).
- Generate standalone pytest files named exactly: 
eval/tests/generated_tests/P1/F/test_F_1.py
…
eval/tests/generated_tests/P1/F/test_F_10.py


Each test file MUST:
- Import the real function under test (e.g., from requests.utils import F)
- Define exactly ONE test function (def test_...)
- Test exactly ONE scenario (avoid multiple independent cases in one file)
- Avoid real network calls
- Be runnable independently (no reliance on other generated tests)
- Prefer real Requests objects created via public APIs; mock only external side effects

Descriptive context (NOT strict requirements):
- The human-written test suite for the selected subset of the Requests functions contains 72 tests total (≈7 tests per function on average, unevenly distributed).
- When executed in isolation, these human-written tests achieve approximately 58% coverage measured against the entire library.
- Human-written tests cover on average ~19 executable lines per test.
These values are provided for calibration only.
