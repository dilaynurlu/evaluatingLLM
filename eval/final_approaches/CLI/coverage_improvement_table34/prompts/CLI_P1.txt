STRATEGY: P1 


BEFORE writing any test code for F, perform and OUTPUT a short static analysis for F:
- Repeat this analysis separately for each function F.
- List every conditional branch (if/elif/else) that matters for behavior.
- List every exception that can be raised or handled (raise, try/except).
- List every loop condition / termination behavior.
- For each item, describe one concrete input/state that would trigger it. Keep this analysis concise (bullet points).

Proceed with generating test cases according to the rules in GEMINI.md
