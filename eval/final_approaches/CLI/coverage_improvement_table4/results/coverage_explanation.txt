Depending on this session, can you give me a short paragraph about why you strrugle to each a high coverage as the human written test suite?

✦ I struggled to reach the same coverage (62%) as the human-written test suite primarily because I initially treated the target functions as isolated units, heavily mocking their
  dependencies (rebuild_auth, rebuild_proxies, get_netrc_auth) to ensure test purity. However, since the coverage benchmark includes the code within requests/sessions.py and
  requests/utils.py where these dependencies reside, my mocking strategy actively prevented those lines from executing. The human suite likely employs integration-style tests
  (e.g., using full requests.Session objects with real environment configurations) which naturally exercise these helper functions and their deep logic chains (like proxy
  resolution and netrc parsing) as a side effect of testing the main targets. My subsequent refactoring to remove mocks and use real objects significantly closed this gap,
  proving that "purity" came at the cost of reachable coverage in this specific benchmarking context.

  ✦ Despite significantly improving the suite to 58 tests and achieving ~54% line coverage, the remaining gap to the 62% benchmark stems from unreachable integration paths that are
  likely exercised by the human suite's broader scope. The human tests for functions like resolve_redirects are often part of larger Session.request calls that implicitly trigger
  extensive setup and teardown logic within sessions.py (such as merge_hooks, prepare_request, and full adapter interactions) and utils.py (broader environment parsing). Since I
  am restricted to testing specific functions in isolation—even with requests.Session objects—my tests skip these peripheral code paths that surround the target functions but are
  technically counted in the file-level coverage metrics. To reach 62%, I would need to write tests that effectively simulate full request lifecycles rather than just targeting
  the specific logic of the assigned functions.
