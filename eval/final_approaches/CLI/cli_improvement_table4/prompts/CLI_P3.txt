STRATEGY: P3 

After generating the initial test files for each function according to GEMINI.md, perform the following self refinement loop:

Self Refine Loop:
  1. RUN: 
    Run pytest for each folder and capture failures. 
    Also measure line and branch coverage against the files auth.py, sessions.py and utils.py in requests. 
    Do not attempt to write coverage HTML; terminal report is enough.

  2. CRITIQUE: 
    Then, provide a critique identifying concrete improvements to increase coverage and robustness and to follow good security practices. 
    The critique must be specific (e.g., “your Response.headers is a plain dict causing case-sensitivity; use CaseInsensitiveDict or mutate existing headers mapping”).
  
  3. REFINE: 
    Update ONLY the generated tests under eval/tests/generated_tests/P3/F/ based on your critique. 
    Keep the “one file = one test function = one scenario” rule.


Now proceed to generate the initial test cases according to the rules in GEMINI.md.
Do not perform the Self Refine Loop more than 3 times. Do not loop forever.
