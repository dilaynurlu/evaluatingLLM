You wrote the initial test cases and the critique below. 
Now refine the initial test cases based on your critique.

=================================================================================================================

Initial generated test cases: 
{{GENERATED_TEST_CASES_FROM_STEP_1}}

Generated critique:
{{GENERATED_CRITIQUE_FROM_STEP_2}}

=================================================================================================================

Requirements:
- Improve the test cases according to your critique.
- Output only the improved test-case files.
- Test cases must be fully self-contained and executable as its own file.
- You are not allowed to paste the target function into the test case for self-containtment purposes. 
- Do NOT output your reasoning or critique.
- Do not include Markdown code fences (```), output raw Python files only.
- Each test case must be separated using the delimiter:
  ===TESTCASE_FILE_START===
  (test file content)
  ===TESTCASE_FILE_END===
- In each of these delimeters, you should define only ONE test case with "def"
  

Now generate the refined test cases. Make sure that you are only refining the initial test cases you suggested. Do not add any extra test cases.
